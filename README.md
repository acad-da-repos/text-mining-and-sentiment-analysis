# Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will perform basic text mining and sentiment analysis using NLTK. This is a crucial skill for extracting insights from unstructured text data.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find two function definitions: `tokenize_text(text)` and `analyze_sentiment(text)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions:
    *   `tokenize_text`: Tokenize the input `text` into words using NLTK's `word_tokenize`.
    *   `analyze_sentiment`: Analyze the sentiment of the input `text` using NLTK's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` and return the compound score.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   Explore other text preprocessing techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
*   Investigate other sentiment analysis libraries or pre-trained models.
*   How can you visualize the sentiment distribution in a corpus of text?
